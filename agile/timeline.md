# Complete Timeline: The History of Agile Programming

_January 23, 2026_

From Toyota's factory floors to today's global software industry, this timeline traces the full evolution of agile methodology—its intellectual roots, key breakthroughs, influential figures, landmark publications, and organizational milestones.

---

## Pre-History: Manufacturing and Management Foundations (1940s–1960s)

**1940s** — **Taiichi Ohno** begins developing the Toyota Production System (TPS) at Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan, introducing concepts like just-in-time delivery, continuous improvement (kaizen), and respect for workers that will later influence agile thinking.

**1950** — **W. Edwards Deming** teaches statistical quality control to Japanese engineers; his Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle becomes foundational to iterative improvement philosophies.

**1950s** — **Shigeo Shingo** collaborates with Ohno to refine TPS, developing Single-Minute Exchange of Dies (SMED) and poka-yoke (mistake-proofing) techniques.

**1958–1963** — NASA's **Project Mercury** uses half-day time-boxed iterations with test-first development—planning and writing tests before each micro-increment. Gerald Weinberg later recalls this as deliberate incremental development.

**1961** — IBM's **Federal Systems Division**, seeded by Mercury personnel, becomes a major proponent of iterative approaches for government and aerospace projects.

---

## Early Iterative Development (1968–1988)

**1968** — NATO Software Engineering Conference in Garmisch, Germany coins the term "software crisis" to describe chronic project failures. Brian Randell and F.W. Zurcher present early iterative and incremental development (IID) concepts.

**1970** — **Winston Royce** publishes "Managing the Development of Large Software Systems," which describes sequential phases but explicitly warns this approach "is risky and invites failure." Ironically, the paper becomes misread as an endorsement of waterfall.

**1972** — IBM's **USS Trident submarine** command-and-control project uses four six-month iterations for over one million lines of life-critical code, driven partly by $100,000/day late penalties.

**1975** — **Victor Basili** and **A.J. Turner** publish "Iterative Enhancement: A Practical Technique for Software Development" in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.

**1975–1977** — IBM's **Light Airborne Multipurpose System (LAMPS)** helicopter project employs 45 one-month iterations, each delivered on time and under budget.

**1976** — **Tom Gilb** publishes *Software Metrics*, first introducing "evolution" and "evolutionary" terminology to software development processes.

**1985** — U.S. Department of Defense issues **DoD-STD-2167**, which essentially mandates waterfall for defense contracts, entrenching sequential development despite mounting evidence of its failures.

**1986** — **Hirotaka Takeuchi** and **Ikujiro Nonaka** publish "The New New Product Development Game" in Harvard Business Review, using the rugby "scrum" metaphor for cross-functional teams moving together. This paper later inspires Jeff Sutherland.

**1986** — **Barry Boehm** publishes the spiral model, introducing risk-driven iteration that combines prototyping with structured phases.

**1986** — **CVS (Concurrent Versions System)** created by Dick Grune, enabling collaborative version control that supports iterative development.

**1987** — The **Defense Science Board Task Force** on Military Software, chaired by Fred Brooks, recommends radical overhaul: "DoD-Std-2167 continues to reinforce exactly the document-driven, specify-then-build approach that lies at the heart of so many DoD software problems."

**1988** — Tom Gilb publishes *Principles of Software Engineering Management*, the first book with substantial chapters dedicated to iterative and incremental development. Both Kent Beck and Jim Highsmith later cite it as influential.

**1988** — Taiichi Ohno's *Toyota Production System: Beyond Large-Scale Production* published in English, bringing TPS concepts to Western audiences.

**1991** — **Alistair Cockburn** begins developing the **Crystal** family of methodologies while working at IBM Consulting, recognizing that different project sizes require different approaches.

**1991** — **James Martin** publishes *Rapid Application Development*, popularizing RAD approaches that emphasize prototyping and user involvement.

**1993** — **ThoughtWorks** founded in Chicago by Roy Singham, later becoming a leading agile consultancy.

**1993** — The **Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System (C3)** project initiated to replace multiple legacy COBOL payroll systems with a single Smalltalk/GemStone application for 87,000 employees.

**1994** — **DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method) Consortium** founded in the UK by a group of RAD practitioners including representatives from British Airways, American Express, and Oracle. Introduces MoSCoW prioritization.

**March 25, 1995** — **Ward Cunningham** installs WikiWikiWeb on c2.com, creating the first wiki. The platform enables organic knowledge sharing that spreads XP concepts globally.

**October 1995** — **Ken Schwaber** and **Jeff Sutherland** present Scrum publicly at **OOPSLA 1995** in Austin, Texas—the first formal introduction of Scrum to the worldwide software community.

**March 1996** — **Kent Beck** joins the struggling C3 project at Chrysler, initially for performance tuning, and becomes project leader. He brings in **Ron Jeffries** as the first XP coach.

**1996** — C3 team formally adopts practices that will define XP: pair programming, test-driven development, continuous integration, refactoring, simple design, collective code ownership, sustainable pace, on-site customer, planning game, and small releases.

**1997** — **Feature-Driven Development (FDD)** created by **Jeff De Luca** and **Peter Coad** on a 50-person Singapore bank project. David Anderson (later the Kanban pioneer) participates in the original team.

**1997** — C3 goes live, successfully paying approximately 10,000 salaried Chrysler employees.

**1997** — **Kent Beck** and **Erich Gamma** create **JUnit** on a flight to OOPSLA, making test-driven development practical and spawning the xUnit family of testing frameworks.

**1998** — Daimler-Benz acquires Chrysler; the on-site customer at C3 resigns from burnout and cannot be replaced.

**1999** — C3 development stops; DaimlerChrysler officially cancels the project in February 2000, but by then XP has spread to many other projects.

**October 1999** — **Kent Beck** publishes *Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change*, defining XP's practices and philosophy. Reviewers call it "dynamite" for changing industry thinking.

**October 1999** — **Dave Thomas** and **Andy Hunt** publish *The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master*, introducing concepts like "tracer bullets" and "broken windows."

**1999** — **Martin Fowler** publishes *Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code*, providing a catalog of 70+ refactorings with step-by-step instructions and making code improvement mainstream.

**1999** — A review of U.S. Department of Defense projects reveals 75% failed or were never used, with only 2% deployed without extensive modification—approximately $37 billion in failed spending.
