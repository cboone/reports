# Reports Repository

A collection of detailed reports on various topics, created by Claude.

## Structure

Each topic gets its own directory at the repository root. Reports are Markdown files within those directories.

```
topic-name/
  report-file.md
  another-report.md
```

## Adding New Reports

When adding new reports to the repository:

1. Place files in the appropriate topic directory, creating it if needed. Use lowercase kebab-case for directory names.
2. Update `README.md` to include the new topic section and file links. Topics are listed alphabetically under the `## Topics` heading.
3. Each topic section in the README has a short description paragraph followed by a bulleted list of report links with brief descriptions.

## Report Style

- Reports are comprehensive, long-form Markdown documents.
- Each report includes a last-updated date.
- Use standard Markdown formatting: headings, tables, lists, code blocks.
- Companion reports should cross-reference each other with relative links.
