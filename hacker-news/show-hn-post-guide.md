# How to craft a Show HN post that resonates

_February 3, 2026_

The most successful Show HN posts share a surprising common thread: **authenticity over polish**. Analysis of the top-performing posts from 2024-2026 reveals that personal projects with genuine backstories—often built over multiple years by passionate individuals—dramatically outperform professionally marketed launches. DIY hardware projects achieve front-page status at nearly **3x the rate** of AI-related posts, and open-source projects with clear technical merit consistently reach the top.

The formula is straightforward but counterintuitive: write like you're explaining your project to a technically-minded friend over drinks, provide something people can actually try with zero friction, and be prepared to engage deeply with every commenter—including critics—as if they're doing you a favor.

## Patterns that predict success

### Title conventions that consistently work

The most successful titles follow a clear pattern: **"Show HN: [Name] – [Concrete description of what it does]"** or the more personal **"Show HN: I built/made [thing] to [achieve outcome]"**. Character limits matter—aim for **50 characters or fewer** in your tagline portion.

Titles that perform well share specific characteristics:
- **Personal narrative framing**: "I made," "I built," "I spent X years" creates immediate credibility and human connection
- **Technical specificity**: "CLI for," "library for," "written in Rust" signals substance
- **Clear positioning**: "alternative to [Big Tech product]," "open-source [commercial tool]"
- **Intriguing but honest**: Unusual use cases draw clicks without resorting to clickbait

Strong title examples include "Show HN: htmz – a low power tool for HTML" (specific, humble, technically descriptive) and "Show HN: I spent 7 years creating a programming language" (personal investment, impressive commitment, clear outcome).

**Titles to avoid**: Vague promises ("app that makes X easier"), marketing superlatives ("fastest," "best," "revolutionary"), or anything that sounds like ad copy rather than a conversation with a peer.

### Project types that resonate most strongly

Data analysis of Show HN success rates reveals clear category preferences:

| Category | Probability of reaching 100+ points |
|----------|-------------------------------------|
| DIY Hardware/IoT Projects | **9.4%** |
| Open-Source Projects | **8.8%** |
| Error Handling & Debugging Tools | **7.9%** |
| Programming Language Interpreters | **7.7%** |
| Personal Life Narratives | **6.8%** |

Physical projects that users can see and touch—even virtually through detailed documentation—significantly outperform pure software. Open-source positioning adds roughly **2-3 percentage points** to success probability. Developer tools that solve genuine daily friction (debugging, deployment, code navigation) perform notably better than tools addressing abstract or theoretical problems.

**A critical finding**: AI-related posts underperform expectations despite initial hype. AI coding and AI image generation posts see measurable drops compared to their early momentum, suggesting the audience has developed some fatigue with the category.

### What generates sustained discussion

Threads with 200+ comments share common discussion drivers:

**Technical architecture questions** dominate productive discussions. Commenters want to understand: "How does this compare to existing solutions?" "What's the performance at scale?" "Why did you choose this technology over alternatives?" Projects that can answer these questions with depth and specificity sustain engagement.

**Pricing and business model transparency** either generates positive sentiment or triggers criticism—never indifference. Free and open-source positioning resonates strongly. Hidden pricing or "contact us" models reliably generate negative comments.

**Personal backstory elements** create emotional investment. Explaining why you built something, the challenges you faced, and the time invested transforms commenters from critics into supporters. The most successful creators share their journey authentically.

## Anatomy of an effective Show HN description

Your initial comment is as important as your title. Based on YC moderator guidance and analysis of top posts, an effective description follows this structure:

**Opening (1-2 sentences)**: State what your project does in plain language. No marketing-speak, no hyperbole—just a clear explanation a technical peer would appreciate.

**Problem statement (2-3 sentences)**: Explain why this matters. What frustration led you here? What's broken about current solutions? Be specific rather than generic.

**Backstory (2-3 sentences)**: Share how you came to work on this. Personal context creates connection. "I built this because I was frustrated with..." or "After 3 years of hitting this problem at work..." works better than corporate positioning.

**Technical substance (3-4 sentences)**: Explain your approach with enough detail to satisfy curious engineers. Mention key technical decisions, stack choices, and what makes your implementation different.

**Invitation (1 sentence)**: Ask for specific feedback rather than generic praise. "I'd love feedback on the query syntax" beats "let me know what you think."

**Total length**: 100-200 words. Longer isn't better—density and substance matter more than comprehensiveness.

**Critical style note**: HN moderator dang explicitly states: "Drop ALL marketing/sales language." Single-sentence paragraphs read like sales letters. Feature bullet lists feel promotional. Write in connected paragraphs that flow like conversation.

## Timing, mechanics, and posting strategy

### When to post

Conflicting data suggests timing matters less than quality, but patterns emerge:

- **Mid-week (Tuesday-Thursday)** sees higher traffic but more competition
- **9 AM Eastern / 2 PM UTC** catches both American East Coast and European audiences
- **Weekends** have less competition but fewer potential upvoters

The strategic tradeoff: weekends make reaching the front page easier, but weekdays offer larger audiences. For a strong launch, mid-week morning tends to optimize for visibility.

### The "Show" page advantage

Show HN posts appear on the dedicated `/show` tab even after falling off `/newest`. This provides extended visibility—approximately **3 days** of potential discovery compared to regular posts that quickly disappear. This buffer is why Show HN can be forgiving of imperfect timing.

### The second-chance pool

If your Show HN receives quality but limited attention due to timing, email `hn@ycombinator.com` to request consideration for the second-chance pool. HN actively resurfaces overlooked quality posts.

## How to engage with commenters

Successful Show HN creators demonstrate consistent engagement patterns:

**Response volume matters**. Top performers respond to 50+ comments in high-engagement threads. Fly.io's founder responded to 53 individual comments during their launch. Being present signals that the creator genuinely wants feedback rather than just promotion.

**Treat critics as helpers**. The most effective response strategy: acknowledge valid criticism openly, find something to agree with first, then provide your perspective. "When criticized, act like the critics are doing you a favor—because they are" is canonical HN wisdom. You won't convince the critic, but you'll win over the silent majority reading the exchange.

**Go deep into technical details**. HN's audience is "insatiably curious." Surface-level responses disappoint; detailed explanations of technical decisions, trade-offs, and implementation challenges build credibility and sustain discussion.

**Politely redirect non-target users**. Not every critic is your customer. When someone complains that your tool doesn't solve their specific problem, it's acceptable to acknowledge that they're not the target audience—but do so graciously.

## Anti-patterns that guarantee poor reception

### Vote manipulation (the nuclear mistake)

HN's voting ring detection is sophisticated and unforgiving. **Never** ask friends to upvote, share direct post links for voting campaigns, or coordinate booster comments. Artificial engagement triggers algorithmic penalties that will bury your post.

If you want support, ask people to browse `/newest`, find your post organically, and decide for themselves. Even this should involve different people for each attempt to avoid detection patterns.

### Other guaranteed failures

- **Signup walls**: Requiring an account to try your product generates immediate frustration and complaint threads. Make your demo accessible instantly.
- **Marketing language**: Superlatives, sales-speak, and promotional framing close tabs. Write like a peer, not a pitch deck.
- **No product to try**: Landing pages, waitlists, and "coming soon" announcements don't qualify as Show HN. The product must exist and be usable.
- **Vague value propositions**: If commenters can't understand what your project does within 10 seconds, they'll move on.
- **Hidden pricing**: Anything that feels like a bait-and-switch ("book a demo for pricing") triggers community skepticism.
- **Company username**: An account named after your product creates an immediate sense of promotion rather than participation.
- **Reposting too frequently**: Show HN reposts should happen only for major overhauls—once or twice per year maximum.

## Actionable checklist for launching a developer tool

**Before posting:**
- [ ] GitHub repository is public with clear README (this is your landing page)
- [ ] One-command installation works (`npx`, `cargo install`, `pip install`)
- [ ] Demo or playground available with no signup required
- [ ] Pricing (if any) is visible and straightforward
- [ ] Personal account (not branded company account) is established with some history

**Title construction:**
- [ ] Format: "Show HN: [Name] – [what it does in technical terms]"
- [ ] Under 80 characters total, tagline under 50 characters
- [ ] Includes category signal (CLI, library, framework, etc.)
- [ ] No superlatives or marketing language

**Description draft:**
- [ ] Opens with plain-language explanation (1-2 sentences)
- [ ] Includes personal backstory of why you built it
- [ ] Contains technical substance and key decisions
- [ ] Acknowledges limitations honestly
- [ ] Ends with specific feedback invitation
- [ ] 100-200 words, paragraph form, conversational tone

**Launch execution:**
- [ ] Post mid-week, morning US Eastern time
- [ ] Block 2-3 hours immediately after posting for comment engagement
- [ ] Respond to every comment with substance
- [ ] Accept criticism gracefully, provide technical depth

**After posting:**
- [ ] Monitor for 3 days (Show HN extended visibility window)
- [ ] Implement suggested improvements visibly
- [ ] If strong quality but limited traction, email `hn@ycombinator.com` for second-chance consideration

## Conclusion

The most successful Show HN posts succeed because they feel like genuine contributions to a technical community rather than promotional campaigns. The pattern is clear: **build something real, explain it honestly, let people try it immediately, and engage as a peer rather than a vendor**.

Developer tools face particular scrutiny on HN—the audience knows the landscape intimately and will immediately compare your work to alternatives. The winning strategy isn't differentiation through marketing but differentiation through **technical substance, honest positioning, and authentic engagement**. Open-source releases, Rust/Go implementations, and privacy-first architectures all carry positive signal. Hidden pricing, signup walls, and promotional language carry negative signal.

The counterintuitive insight: time invested matters more than polish. A project you've genuinely used for years will outperform a polished launch of something you built last month. The HN community values authenticity over presentation, substance over style, and contribution over self-promotion.
