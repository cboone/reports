# Timeline: The History of Self and Its Legacy

_January 23, 2026_

## Predecessors

**1972** — Smalltalk created at Xerox PARC by Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls, and Adele Goldstein

**1980** — Smalltalk-80 released publicly; becomes dominant dynamic OO language

**1984** — David Ungar completes Berkeley PhD on Smalltalk performance (Generation Scavenging GC)

**1986** — Randall B. Smith creates Alternate Reality Kit at Xerox PARC — prototype-based predecessor to Self

-----

## The PARC Era (1985–1987)

**1985** — Ungar joins Smith at Xerox PARC; they begin designing Self

**1986** — Self language design completed at PARC

-----

## The Stanford Era (1987–1991)

**1987** — Ungar moves to Stanford as assistant professor; implementation begins with graduate students Craig Chambers and Urs Hölzle

**1987** — First Self compiler completed

**1987** — "Self: The Power of Simplicity" published at OOPSLA — later named one of three most influential OOPSLA papers (1986–1996)

**1989** — "An Efficient Implementation of Self" published — introduces maps (hidden classes)

**1990** — Self publicly released

**1991** — "Polymorphic Inline Caches" paper published at ECOOP by Hölzle, Chambers, and Ungar

-----

## The Sun Microsystems Era (1991–1995)

**1991** — Self project moves to Sun Microsystems Labs; Lars Bak and Mario Wolczko join the team

**1992** — Craig Chambers completes PhD thesis on Self compiler

**1993** — Morphic UI framework developed by John Maloney and Randall B. Smith

**1994** — Urs Hölzle completes PhD thesis "Adaptive Optimization for Self" — foundational work on type feedback and deoptimization

**1995** — Self 4.0 released with redesigned programming environment

**1995** — Java launched; Sun redirects resources away from Self

**1995** — Self project officially ends at Sun

-----

## Immediate Descendants (1993–1995)

**1993** — NewtonScript created for Apple Newton PDA — adopts Self's prototype model

**1993** — Lua 1.0 released — later adopts Self-style delegation via metatables

**1995** — JavaScript created by Brendan Eich at Netscape — directly adopts Self's prototype-based inheritance

-----

## The VM Legacy (1994–2008)

**1994** — Hölzle and Bak co-found Animorphic Systems; build Strongtalk VM using Self techniques

**1997** — Sun acquires Animorphic Systems

**1999** — Java HotSpot VM released — directly derived from Self/Strongtalk technology

**2002** — Io language created by Steve Dekorte — explicitly inspired by Self

**2006** — Google hires Lars Bak to build Chrome's JavaScript engine

**2008** — V8 JavaScript engine released — implements Self's hidden classes, inline caches, and adaptive optimization

-----

## Modern Era (2006–Present)

**2006** — Self 4.3 released (first release in 11 years)

**2010** — Self 4.4 released with Linux support by community maintainers

**2017** — Self 2017.1 released (new versioning scheme)

**August 2024** — Self 2024.1 released with FreeBSD and NetBSD support

**Present** — Self maintained on GitHub; V8 and HotSpot continue to use Self's optimization techniques in billions of devices worldwide
