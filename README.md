# Reports

Detailed reports on various topics, created by LLMs, usually the latest version of Claude. Everything in here was written by an LLM (other than this intro). Often multiple LLMs, or at least multiple rounds without preserving context, were used to fact-check, increase accuracy, and fill in gaps. I did my best to encourage real references, citations, etc. But you know how this works. Double check anything important.

## Agile

The complete history of agile methodology, from its roots in Toyota's manufacturing philosophy through the 2001 Snowbird meeting to modern enterprise adoption and ongoing debates.

### [The complete history of agile: from Toyota to transformation](agile/history.md)

_January 23, 2026_

How agile methodology emerged from three tributaries — Toyota's production system, early iterative experiments at NASA and IBM, and mounting evidence of waterfall's failures — and what happened after 17 practitioners met in Utah's Wasatch Mountains.

### [Complete timeline of agile programming](agile/timeline.md)

_January 23, 2026_

Chronological timeline from Toyota's factory floors to today's global software industry, covering intellectual roots, key breakthroughs, influential figures, and landmark publications.

### [Agile methodology: sources and references](agile/bibliography.md)

_January 23, 2026_

Primary sources, foundational documents, and further reading for the history of agile.

## LLM Coding Agents

A comprehensive survey of the tooling ecosystem around LLM coding agents as of February 2026.

### [Every LLM coding agent for the terminal in early 2026](llm-agents/coding-agent-clis.md)

_February 10, 2026_

Catalog of over 90 CLI and TUI coding tools that use large language models, organized into categories (full-featured agents, chat/REPL tools, shell assistants, multi-agent frameworks, orchestration tools) with comparison tables and landscape analysis.

### [Axes for reasoning about LLM agent tool use](llm-agents/agent-tool-axes.md)

_February 10, 2026_

A framework of eight independent axes — interaction topology, autonomy, security surface, state mutation, determinism, error recovery, context cost, and trust boundary — for reasoning about the design space of agent-tool systems.

### [LLM coding agent instruction files: comparing CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, copilot-instructions.md, and SKILL.md](llm-agents/agent-instruction-files.md)

_February 15, 2026_

How the four major instruction file formats compare across Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, and OpenCode, with concrete recommendations for cross-tool compatibility.

### [LLM coding agent configuration files: comparing Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, and OpenCode](llm-agents/agent-config-files.md)

_February 15, 2026_

Where every config file lives, what it controls, and which files should be committed to version control, across the four major LLM coding agents.

### [LLM coding agent monitoring, session management, and notification tools](llm-agents/llm-agent-monitoring-tools.md)

_February 15, 2026_

Every notable tool for monitoring LLM coding agent activity, managing sessions, receiving notifications, and tracking usage and costs — desktop session managers, terminal TUIs, mobile clients, notification hooks, cost trackers, and observability platforms.

### [Parallel LLM coding agents with tmux and git worktrees](llm-agents/tmux-worktree-tools.md)

_February 15, 2026_

Survey of tools for managing parallel agent sessions with tmux and git worktrees, from full-featured TUI session managers to lightweight shell scripts, with architectural analysis and recommendations by use case.

## Self

The history and legacy of the Self programming language, designed in 1986 at Xerox PARC. A prototype-based language that pioneered the optimization techniques now used in V8, HotSpot, and every major JavaScript engine.

### [Self: the invisible language that powers modern computing](self/history.md)

_January 23, 2026_

How a radical simplification of Smalltalk — removing classes entirely in favor of prototypes — produced the optimization techniques that now power every major JavaScript engine and the Java Virtual Machine.

### [Timeline of Self and its legacy](self/timeline.md)

_January 23, 2026_

Chronological timeline from Self's design at Xerox PARC through its influence on JavaScript, Java HotSpot, and modern JIT compilation.

### [The Self programming language: key papers and resources](self/bibliography.md)

_January 23, 2026_

Key academic papers and resources on Self and its technical legacy.
